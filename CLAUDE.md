# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a learning repository (`learn-ai`) for aggregating AI-related tutorials and exercises. The repository is currently in its initial setup phase with minimal code structure.

## Current Structure

- Empty repository with basic README.md
- SpecStory integration configured for AI chat history preservation
- Cursor indexing configured to exclude auto-save files

## Development Environment

- No specific language or framework detected yet
- No build scripts or package managers currently configured
- Repository ready for adding AI learning materials and exercises

## Notes

- This appears to be a clean slate repository intended for AI learning content
- Future Claude Code instances should expect this to grow into a collection of tutorials and coding exercises
- The repository uses SpecStory for preserving AI interaction history
